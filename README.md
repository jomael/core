Containers and other utility libraries in standard C99.

[https://octaspire.io](https://octaspire.io)

Please use the amalgamated release
`octaspire-core-amalgamated.c` that
can be found from the `release`-directory.

It contains **everything** needed to build
and run unit test runner or use Core
in other programs.

The Makefile is used only in development
builds when developing Core itself, and it
will run only on some platforms. The amalgamated
release can be used in all platforms without
any build or metabuild tools.

See the manual for more information.
